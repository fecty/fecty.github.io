        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I am a passionate student developer from Kashmir Valley, a placed nestled in the Himalayas. I have been
          programming as a hobby since 2019. I love programming and Computer Science, and a large reason behind my
          love for this field stems from an interesting story. I learned to program in Python without any resources or
          courses, except for the documentation provided by the interpreter, because I was stuck in a place with no
          internet for 6 months. This experience turned me into an avid programmer by redefining and realigning my
          hobbies and interest.</p>
        <p>
          I Demonstrated success as a freelancer and tech consultant when I was in 9th grade. I made several projects
          which are used by clients and college students worldwide. Some of my IoT projects were also exhibited
          in national events. I am fairly skilled in Python, C/C++ and moderately skilled in JavaScript and Rust. Having
          worked as a freelancer who had to tackle varied projects, I have hands on experience in various technologies,
          frameworks and libraries. This includes web development(full stack), CLI/GUI based software development,
          relational and nonrelational databases, programming in embedded systems, DSA projects, networking projects,
          and various other projects. I am highly proficient in adapting to new languages, libraries, frameworks, and
          technologies very quickly. Always focused on writing high-quality and resource efficient software.
