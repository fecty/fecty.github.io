        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p id=" current-status" style="display: none;">To be written... </p>
        <p id="background" style="display: none;">To be written... </p>

        <p>
          I am a passionate student developer from Kashmir Valley, a placed
          nestled in the Himalayas. I have been programming as a hobby since
          2019. I love programming and Computer Science, and a large reason
          behind my love for this field stems from an interesting story.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned to program in Python without any resources or courses,
          except for the documentation provided by the interpreter, because I
          was stuck in a place with no internet for 6 months. This experience
          turned me into an avid programmer by redefining and realigning my
          hobbies and interest.
        </p>

        <p>
          I demonstrated success as a freelancer and tech consultant when I
          was in 9th grade. I made several projects which are used by clients
          and college students worldwide. Some of my IoT projects were also
          exhibited in national events. I am fairly skilled in Python, C/C++
          and moderately skilled in JavaScript and Rust. Having worked as a
          freelancer who had to tackle varied projects, I have hands on
          experience in various technologies, frameworks and libraries. </p>

        <p>
          This
          includes web development(full stack), CLI/GUI based software
          development, relational and nonrelational databases, programming in
          embedded systems, DSA projects, networking projects, and various
          other projects. I am highly proficient in adapting to new languages,
          libraries, frameworks, and technologies very quickly. Always focused
          on writing high-quality and resource efficient software.
